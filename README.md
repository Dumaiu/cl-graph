# CL-GRAPH (yet another fork)
Fork of https://github.com/gwkkwg/cl-graph: 'Common Lisp library for manipulating graphs and running graph algorithms'

* [2021-12-10 Fri] 
    * FIXME: I don't know much about the `lift` test library, but `(test-system :cl-graph)` starts running tests, which start to fail.
    * TODO: `(make-load-form)` for DOT graph components
    * TODO: Is it realistic to build a graph /from/ a .dot file?
